# ðŸ§  CPU Pinning Manager for oVirt VMs

A command-line utility written in pure Python (no external dependencies) to manage CPU pinning for virtual machines in oVirt environments.  
It generates pinning strings compatible with oVirt's **manual CPU pinning** mode and ensures CPU allocations are tracked and conflict-free.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Allocate vCPUs to physical cores with optional socket targeting
- âœ… Avoid CPU reuse by tracking all pinning in a JSON file
- âœ… Support for multi-socket distribution
- âœ… View free logical CPUs
- âœ… Remove or reassign VMs safely
- âœ… Clear CLI output and formatting
- âœ… Fully type-annotated and cleanly structured

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Linux system with `lscpu` available (usually pre-installed)
